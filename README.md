# indeedwebscraping
A study performed by a team I was part of during my Rutgers Spring 2017 Semester that web scraped Indeed Data Analyst Job postings to find out about the most relevant and needed skills in the field.
We extracted data from job postings in Indeed.com to perform clustering analysis and pick up on most demanded skills in the field. We later used those clusters to classify the instance we collected and see if any correlation existed between these clusters found and the data. Our findings showed that Data Science/Data Analytics is composed of other subfields (5 clusters in our study). 
We were able to find out that the most relevant skillset demanded at the time was Hadoop, suggesting that most companies out there were looking for Big Data Analytics.
